# datastructureinc
This project covers code for various data structure questions.

It covers

1. Searching: Linear and Binary, 
   - Linear search,
   - Binary search.
   
2. Sorting: various sorting techniques covered, 
   - Bubble sort,
   - Insertion sort,
   - Selection sort,
   - Quick sort.
   
3. Linked list: various operations on linked list performed, 
  - Double Linked list
    Operations covered are 
            Addition of node at the start, after a node and at the last.
            Deletion of node - head node, last node or a specified node.
            
  - Circular Linked List
  
4. Tree: tree formation, tree traversal, depth, mirrorTheTree, 
  - Preorder traversal without recursion,
  - Postorder traversal without recursion,
  - Inorder traversal without recursion,
  - Breadth first traversal.
  
5. Stack: sample implementation,
